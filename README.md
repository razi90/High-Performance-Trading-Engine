# High-Performance Trading Engine in Rust

## Project Overview

This project is a high-performance, low-latency trading engine implemented in Rust, designed to demonstrate advanced systems programming techniques in the financial technology domain.

## Key Objectives

The trading engine aims to create a robust, efficient, and scalable system for:
- Order matching
- Market data processing
- Risk management
- Algorithmic trading strategy implementation

## Technical Highlights

### Core Features
- Lock-free order book implementation
- Zero-copy market data parsing
- Atomically updated risk management system
- Event-driven strategy framework
- Low-latency networking capabilities

### Performance Principles
- Nanosecond-level operation times
- Minimal memory allocations
- SIMD optimizations
- Compile-time correctness guarantees

## Technical Challenges Addressed

1. **Order Matching Engine**
   - Implemented with price-time priority
   - Support for multiple matching algorithms
   - Efficient data structures for rapid order processing

2. **Market Data Processing**
   - Zero-copy parsing of financial protocols
   - Efficient circular buffer implementation
   - Streaming data aggregation

3. **Risk Management**
   - Atomic state updates
   - Compile-time rule enforcement
   - Dynamic circuit breakers

4. **Networking**
   - Low-latency WebSocket API
   - Real-time market data streaming
   - Efficient REST endpoint management

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: Rust
- **Concurrency**: crossbeam
- **Networking**: Tokio
- **Performance Profiling**: perf, flame graphs

## Development Roadmap

- [x] Basic order book structure
- [ ] Advanced matching algorithms
- [ ] Market data parser
- [ ] Risk management system
